# Tesla Battery Analysis ðŸš—ðŸ”‹

This repository contains Python code for analyzing data related to Tesla batteries. We aim to derive insights from the provided dataset using pandas, matplotlib, and machine learning techniques.

## Data Import
We start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Import data into Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_excel(r'/content/Tesla Battery Survey.xlsx', sheet_name='All entries')
```

## Data Processing
We perform various data processing tasks such as calculating cumulated energy use, equivalent full cycles, and vehicle age.

```python
# Calculating Cumulated energy use and Equivalent full cycles
df['Cumulated energy use'] = df['Lifetime average [Wh/mi or Wh/km]?'] * df['Your range at 100%']
df['EFC'] = df['Mileage [km]'] * df['Your range at 100%']

# Convert date columns to pd.to_datetime for calculating the difference in days for vehicle age
df[['Date you charged to 100%','Manufacture date']] = df[['Date you charged to 100%','Manufacture date']].apply(pd.to_datetime)
df["Vehicle age"] = abs(df['Date you charged to 100%'] - df['Manufacture date']).dt.days / 356
```

## Data Visualization
We visualize the data using line plots and scatter plots to gain insights into the relationship between relative range and vehicle age.

## Model Estimation
We create a linear model to estimate relative range from vehicle age using least square error optimization.

## Error Analysis
We plot the distribution of model estimation errors and calculate the standard error of the relative range estimates.
